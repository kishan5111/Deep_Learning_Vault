## Notebooks 📓

The [`notebooks`](https://github.com/kishan5111/Deep_Learning_Vault/tree/main/notebooks) directory contains a variety of Jupyter notebooks covering different topics in deep learning. These notebooks are a combination of my own creations, code from Kaggle competitions, and exercises from courses I am currently enrolled in. Each notebook is self-contained and provides explanations, code examples, and practical exercises to enhance understanding. Feel free to explore, learn from, and build upon them.

## Projects 🚀

In the `projects` directory, you will find hands-on projects that showcase the application of deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems. These projects are primarily based on my own ideas and implementation but may also include projects inspired by Kaggle competitions or course assignments. They serve as practical demonstrations of various models, frameworks, and methodologies in the field of deep learning.

## Resources 📚

The [`resources`](https://github.com/kishan5111/Deep_Learning_Vault/tree/main/resources) directory hosts additional resources such as tutorials, articles, datasets, and pretrained models. These resources have been carefully curated to complement the learning material found in the notebooks and projects. They can be valuable references for expanding your knowledge and enhancing your skills in deep learning.
